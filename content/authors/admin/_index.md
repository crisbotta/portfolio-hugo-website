Digital media specialist, interested in digital artifacts preservation and archiving, software and video game studies and history, and the use of technology in education. I have ten years experience working with diverse communities in digital literacy and STEAM in informal education. I also continue brushing up my design skills and keeping up with trends, changes, and the state of the art in design, UX and UI.

In my spare time I like hiking, backing, building with LEGO, drawing and painting, playing strategy video games, and reading non-fiction from areas completely unrelated to my research. I contribute to some open-source software projects (at the moment only with translations, testing and feedback, but I want to contribute with code in the future).
